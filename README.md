# Jessi Software Engineer Facts   


- Hi I'm Jessi, I'm Software Engineer who believes in building and using technology rooted by love to help each other, progress our lives for the good of     humanity.

- To me staying humble is a workout within you that builds courage, knowledge, wisdom, strength and compassion while using your ambitions to fuel you to     get things done.

- Learning is an infinite journey. I'm a student of the universe who loves to study, putting in my time, while taking self accountability serious with a     healthy balance staying focused.

- Being a valuable asset to a company is just as important as valuing opportunities that contribute to my growth.  Win, Win.  


# Projects

- Iâ€™m currently working on projects using Javascript, Node, MERN, Python and Django.
  
- It's our duty as engineers / humans to work on our own self development. Life is too precious and rad to be lazy. Make it happen. No matter what project   I'm working on, I never give up. Some projects have a short deadline (get it done ðŸ’¯) and other projects can take months to years. Whatever the case may   be, I don't stop, won't stop. ðŸ’¯


# Collaborations and Programming Sessions

- I love working with people, teams and mentors that have a positive mindsets, whom stay calm and stay kind while going through code.

- Energy is everything, it's important to protect your energy, keep calm, stay positive, know that you will solve your problem. 

- Teams that have the ability to trust & feel confident about helping each other, is a successful Healthy and Balanced team. Yes, it's rare & I treasure     it. 

- I've worked with teams and also taken projects programming & developing alone. This being said, I can work alone and be here for my team when they         need me, vise versa.

- My background is unique, so my thought process can be different at times and that's ok. I embrace being `unique`  and I like writing things down whenever   I feel the need to. 

- I trust and honor my team / collaborators. No matter how stuck an engineer is, putting them down is never an option. I'll do my best teach, guide or       mentor with repect for each other. 

- Trust, we Software Engineers know how `Serious` it is to work with `Sensative Data`. ðŸ’¯  

  
# Communication

- Communication is the root of a great professional relationship.

- I will communicate with you in a humble and respectable manner. ( If we're buddies you already know )

- Talking it out is a necessary nutrient to find a balance with colleages, team leaders & stakeholders in order to find clarity and grow stronger together.

- If you want to chop it up, I'm all ears. 

- If I have questions, I will let you know rooted with good intentions, focus, determination and a splash of good vibes for the love of it. 

- As a natural artist, I'm in my mind working, detailing, building code, solving problems, hearing a beat, designing a graphic in my head etc. ect. So,       please never assume you know what I'm thinking with a negative mindset. Assuming can be a room filled with of misconceptions and perspectives. If you do   know how to read people, you will find that, I'm chill, I got nothin but love to give, you can ask me anything.

- We must be accountable for our own happiness and have respectful boundaries with each other. Everything isn't always perfect, yet the beauty is, what       you're learning from your experiences, which creates self growth. Let's grow together and water ourselves as we grow. ðŸŒ±
