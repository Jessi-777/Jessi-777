Hi, I am a Full Stack Engineer. I enjoy Developing and Designing Full Stack Software Architecture, UI/UX, Testing, Implmenting Code and I'm not afraid to work with sensative data. I've use technologies such as React, Redux, Javascript, Express, MongoDB, Docker, 3rd Party Apis, AWS, and Node, Python Django, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Jest, + . I'm open to learning any language that is neccesary to develop the catered product. I have a strong understanding of both frontend and backend. I am currently open to joining a healthy company where I can continue to grow and keep developing my skills with a positive mindset, passion and accountability. I'm a quick learner and a team player, and I am confident that I will be a valuable asset to any Software Engineering team. ^_^
