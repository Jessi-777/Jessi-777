Hi, I am a Full Stack Engineer. Currently, I've achieved building and designing software architecture, and developing code with technologies such as React, Redux, Javascript, Express, MongoDB, 3rd Party Apis, AWS, and Node. I've also had experience working on full stack projects with Python Django, and PostgreSQL. I have a strong understanding of both frontend and backend. I'm open to joining a healthy company where I can continue to grow and keep developing my skills with a positive mindset, passion and accountability. I'm a quick learner and a team player, and I am confident that I will be a valuable asset to any Software Engineering team. Win, win. ^_^
