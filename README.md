Hi, I am a Full Stack Engineer. I enjoy Developing and Designing Full Stack Software Architecture, UI/UX, Testing, Implementing Code, and working with sensitive data. I've used technologies such as React, Redux, Javascript, Express, MongoDB, Docker, 3rd Party Apis, AWS, Node, Python Django, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Jest, and +. I'm open to learning any language that is necessary to develop the catered product. I have a strong understanding of both frontend and backend. I am currently open to joining a healthy company where I can continue to grow and keep developing my skills with a positive mindset, passion, and accountability. I'm a quick learner and a team player, and I am confident that I will be a valuable asset to any Software Engineering team. Win, win. ^_^
