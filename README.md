### Jessi the Software Engineer   


- Hi I'm Jessi, I'm Software Engineer who believes in building and using technology rooted by love to help each other, progress our lives for the good of     humanity.

- To me staying humble is a workout within you that builds courage, knowledge, wisdom, strength and compassion while using your ambitions to fuel you to     get things done. 

- My goal in life has always been about loving what I do. This way, I am passionate about what I do and happy to deliver doing it. 

- Learning is an infinite journey. I'm a student of the universe who loves to study, putting in my time, while taking self accountability serious with a     healthy balance staying focused.


# Projects

- Iâ€™m currently working on projects using Javascript, Node, MERN, Python and Django.

- shout out to my business partners ( show love and value your team ) 
  
- It's our duty as engineers / humans to work on our own self development. Life is too precious and rad to be lazy. Make it happen. No matter what project   I'm working on, I never give up. Some projects have a short deadline (get it done ðŸ’¯) and other projects can take months to years. Whatever the case may   be, I don't stop, won't stop. ðŸ’¯


# Collaborations and Programming Sessions

- I love working with people, teams and mentors that have a positive mindsets, whom stay calm and stay kind while going through code.

- Energy is everything, it's important to protect your energy, keep calm, stay positive, know that you will solve your problem. 

- Teams that have the ability to trust & feel confident about helping each other, is a successful Healthy and Balanced team. Yes, it's rare. Treasure it. 

- I've worked with teams and also taken projects programming & developing alone. This being said, I can work alone and be here for my team when they         need me, vise versa.

- My background is unique, so my thought process can be different at times and that's ok. I embrace being `unique` I like writing things down whenever I     feel the need to. 

- I trust and honor my team / collaborators. No matter how stuck an engineer is, never put them down. Teach, guide or mentor, always lift up the             people. Being realist is important. But, being mean about it is never necessary.

- We Software Engineers know how `Serious` we need to becareful with `sensative data`. ðŸ’¯  

  
# Communication

- Communication is the root of a great professional / friend relationship.

- I will communicate with you in a humble and respectable manner. ( If we're buddies you already know )

- Talking it out is a necessary nutrient to find a balance with colleages, team leaders & stakeholders in order to find clarity and grow stronger together.

- If you want to chop it up, I'm all ears. 

- If I have questions, I will let you know with good vibes. ðŸ’¯

- As a natural artist, I'm in my mind working, detailing, building code, solving problems, hearing a beat, designing a graphic in my head etc. ect. So, please never     assume you know what I'm thinking with a negative mindset. Assuming can be a room filled with of misconceptions and perspectives. If you do know how to     read people, you will find that, I'm chill, I got nothin but love to give, you can ask me anything.


# Mental and verbal abuse is real in our society ( Let's be real ) 

- Never let anyone make you feel any way for how you process what you learn. Everyone has a different learning process, I truly respect that. 
 
- I take verbal abuse very seriuosly. I will not tolerate verbal and mental abuse from anyone who loses their patience, because they had a bad day, or       chant on a daily how horrible their life is. 

- We must be accountable for our own happiness and have respectful boundaries with each other.

- One experience is all it takes to grow through a senerio like that, to learn how important it is to be in a positive environment `Know Your Worth`.

 
# Let's keep focused on love and growth. 
* Let's get it !!
