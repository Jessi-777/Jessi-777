# Jessi's Software Engineer (About me and working together) README.md    

- Hi, I'm Jessi, I build and use technology to help contribute and add value to our lives for the good of humanity. Learning is an infinite journey. I'm a student of the universe who loves to study, put in my time, solve problems, and develop. I take self/team accountability seriously with a positive mindset, and a healthy balance while staying focused. Being a valuable asset to a company is just as important as valuing opportunities that contribute to my growth. Win, Win!

# Projects

- I've built Full-Stack products using Javascript, Node, MERN, HTML, CSS Python and Django. During my 3 years experience with implmenting Software architecting process, designing framework, securing the architecture software, developing functionality, performance, scalability, technology constraints, designing trade-offs, and testing with 100% coverage using typedocs. This journey has lead me to a place where I am looking forward to continuing my growth with a company that aligns with me. It's our duty as engineers / humans to work on our own self development. Life is too precious and rad to be lazy. Make it happen. 
  
# Collaborations and Programming Sessions

- I love working with people, teams and mentors that have a positive mindsets, whom stay calm and stay kind while going through code. Energy is everything, it's important to protect your energy, keep calm, stay positive, know that you will solve your problem. Teams that have the ability to trust & feel confident about helping each other, is a successful Healthy and Balanced team. Yes, it's rare & I treasure it. I've worked with teams and also taken projects programming & developing alone. This being said, I can work alone and be here for my team when they need me, vise versa. Embracing change as we grow with positive and clear intentions is important. My background is unique, I stay humble and I trust, my team / collaborators. I do my best teach, guide or mentor teamates with respect. Trust, we Software Engineers know how `Serious` it is to work with `Sensative Data`. ðŸ’¯ 
 

# Communication

- Communication is the root of a great professional relationship. I will communicate with you in a humble and respectable manner. (If we're buddies you already know) Talking it out is a necessary nutrient to find a balance with colleages, team leaders & stakeholders in order to find clarity and grow stronger together. If you want to chop it up, I'm all ears. If I have questions, I will let you know rooted with good intentions, focus, determination and good vibes for the love of it. We must be accountable for our own happiness and have respectful boundaries with each other. Everything isn't always perfect, yet the beauty is, taking what we've learned from our experiences and letting it make us better, creating self growth. Let's grow together and water ourselves as we grow. ðŸŒ± 

# Let's stay focused on purpose and growth. 

* Let's get it !!
