# Jessi's Software Engineer Facts README.md   

- Hi I'm Jessi, I'm Software Engineer who believes in building and using technology rooted by love to help each other, progress our lives for the good ofhumanity. To me staying humble is a workout within you that builds courage, knowledge, wisdom, strength and compassion while using your ambitions to fuel you to get things done. My goal in life has always been about loving what I do. This way, I am passionate about what I do and happy to deliver doing it. Learning is an infinite journey. I'm a student of the universe who loves to study, putting in my time, while taking self / team accountability serious with a healthy balance staying focused. Being a valuable asset to a company is just as important as valuing opportunities that contribute to my growth. Win, Win!

# Projects

- I’m currently working on projects using Javascript, Node, MERN, Python and Django. It's our duty as engineers / humans to work on our own self development. Life is too precious and rad to be lazy. Make it happen. No matter what project I'm working on, I never give up. Some projects have a short deadline (get it done 💯) and other projects can take months to years. Whatever the case may be, I don't stop, won't stop.
  
# Collaborations and Programming Sessions

- I love working with people, teams and mentors that have a positive mindsets, whom stay calm and stay kind while going through code. Energy is everything, it's important to protect your energy, keep calm, stay positive, know that you will solve your problem. Teams that have the ability to trust & feel confident about helping each other, is a successful Healthy and Balanced team. Yes, it's rare & I treasure it. I've worked with teams and also taken projects programming & developing alone. This being said, I can work alone and be here for my team when they need me, vise versa. My background is unique, so my thought process can be different at times and that's ok. I embrace being `unique`  and I like writing things down whenever I feel the need to. I trust and honor my team / collaborators. No matter how stuck an engineer is, putting them down is never an option. I'll do my best teach, guide or mentor with repect for each other. Trust, we Software Engineers know how `Serious` it is to work with `Sensative Data`. 💯 
 

# Communication

- Communication is the root of a great professional relationship. I will communicate with you in a humble and respectable manner. (If we're buddies you already know) Talking it out is a necessary nutrient to find a balance with colleages, team leaders & stakeholders in order to find clarity and grow stronger together. If you want to chop it up, I'm all ears. If I have questions, I will let you know rooted with good intentions, focus, determination and a splash of good vibes for the love of it. We must be accountable for our own happiness and have respectful boundaries with each other. Everything isn't always perfect, yet the beauty is, taking what we've learned from our experiences and letting it make us better, creating self growth. Let's grow together and water ourselves as we grow. 🌱 

# Let's stay focused on Purpose and Growth. 

* Let's get it !!
