Hi, I am a Full Stack Engineer. Currently, my achievements are building and designing software architecture, and developing code with technologies such as React, Redux, Javascript, Express, MongoDB, 3rd Party Apis, AWS, and Node. Along with working on projects with Python Django, and PostgreSQL. I have a strong understanding of both frontend and backend. I'm open to joining a healthy company where I can continue to grow and keep developing my skills. I'm a quick learner and a team player, and I am confident that I will be a valuable asset to any Software Engineering team. Win, win. ^_^
