# Jessi's Software Engineer (How to work with each other) README.md    

- Hi I'm Jessi, I build and use technology to help contribute and add value to our lives for the good of humanity. Learning is an infinite journey. I'm a student of the universe who loves to study, putting in my time, solving problems and developing. I take self / team accountability serious with a positive mind set, healthy balance while staying focused. Being a valuable asset to a company is just as important as valuing opportunities that contribute to my growth. Win, Win!

# Projects

- I have experience with building Full-Stack projects using Javascript, Node, MERN, HTML, CSS Python and Django. My experience with Software architecting process, designing framework, securing the architecture software, developing functionality, performance, scalability, technology constraints, designing trade-offs, Testing with 100% coverage using typedocs. Has lead me to a place where I am looking forward to continuing my growth with a company that aligns with me. It's our duty as engineers / humans to work on our own self development. Life is too precious and rad to be lazy. Make it happen. No matter what project I'm working on, I never give up. Some projects have a short deadline (get it done ðŸ’¯) and other projects can take months to years. Whatever the case may be, I don't stop, won't stop. 
  
# Collaborations and Programming Sessions

- I love working with people, teams and mentors that have a positive mindsets, whom stay calm and stay kind while going through code. Energy is everything, it's important to protect your energy, keep calm, stay positive, know that you will solve your problem. Teams that have the ability to trust & feel confident about helping each other, is a successful Healthy and Balanced team. Yes, it's rare & I treasure it. I've worked with teams and also taken projects programming & developing alone. This being said, I can work alone and be here for my team when they need me, vise versa. Embracing change as we grow with positive and clear intentions is important. My background is unique, so my thought process can be different at times and that's ok. I embrace being `unique`  and I like writing things down whenever I feel the need to. I trust and honor my team / collaborators. No matter how stuck an engineer is, putting them down is never an option. I'll do my best teach, guide or mentor with repect for each other. Trust, we Software Engineers know how `Serious` it is to work with `Sensative Data`. ðŸ’¯ 
 

# Communication

- Communication is the root of a great professional relationship. I will communicate with you in a humble and respectable manner. (If we're buddies you already know) Talking it out is a necessary nutrient to find a balance with colleages, team leaders & stakeholders in order to find clarity and grow stronger together. If you want to chop it up, I'm all ears. If I have questions, I will let you know rooted with good intentions, focus, determination and a splash of good vibes for the love of it. We must be accountable for our own happiness and have respectful boundaries with each other. Everything isn't always perfect, yet the beauty is, taking what we've learned from our experiences and letting it make us better, creating self growth. Let's grow together and water ourselves as we grow. ðŸŒ± 

# Let's stay focused on purpose and growth. 

* Let's get it !!
